_Predicting flood extent caused by storms in southern Malawi

## Introduction

This post describes the use of the lightgbm library to create a machine learning data pipeline that can predict flood extents from past flood data. The data used in this post is gotten from the Zindiâ€™s [UNICEF Arm 2030 Vision #1: Flood Prediction in Malawi](https://zindi.africa/competitions/2030-vision-flood-prediction-in-malawi).
